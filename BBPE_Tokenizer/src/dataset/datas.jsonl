A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within “to4x4.gr” and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.\nWe may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing “to4x4.gr”, though these are outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter “anonymous posts”), registering on “to4x4.gr” (hereinafter “your account”) and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter “your posts”).\nYour account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter “your user name”), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid email address (hereinafter “your email”). Your information for your account at “to4x4.gr” is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your email address required by “to4x4.gr” during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of “to4x4.gr”. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from the phpBB software.\nYour password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at “to4x4.gr”, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with “to4x4.gr”, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my password” feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.","dump":"your_dataset_name"}

{"id":"<urn:uuid:c8e9f2f5-1509-49ea-920d-db1e9acee2e8>","text":"There are several reasons why this could occur. First, ensure your username and password are correct. If they are, contact the board owner to make sure you haven’t been banned. It is also possible the website owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it.\nTop\n» Why do I need to register at all?\nYou may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However; registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few moments to register so it is recommended you do so.\nTop\n» Why do I get logged off automatically?\nIf you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you login, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university computer lab, etc. If you do not see this checkbox, it means the board administrator has disabled this feature.\nTop\n» How do I prevent my username appearing in the online user listings?\nWithin your User Control Panel, under “Board preferences”, you will find the option Hide your online status. Enable this option with Yes and you will only appear to the administrators, moderators and yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.\nTop\n» I’ve lost my password!\nDon’t panic! While your password cannot be retrieved, it can easily be reset. Visit the login page and click I’ve forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be able to log in again shortly.\nTop\n» I registered but cannot login!\nFirst, check your username and password. If they are correct, then one of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you specified being under 13 years old during registration, you will have to follow the instructions you received. Some boards will also require new registrations to be activated, either by yourself or by an administrator before you can logon; this information was present during registration. If you were sent an e-mail, follow the instructions. If you did not receive an e-mail, you may have provided an incorrect e-mail address or the e-mail may have been picked up by a spam filer. If you are sure the e-mail address you provided is correct, try contacting an administrator.\nTop\n» I registered in the past but cannot login any more?!\nIt is possible an administrator has deactivated or deleted your account for some reason. Also, many boards periodically remove users who have not posted for a long time to reduce the size of the database. If this has happened, try registering again and being more involved in discussions.\nTop\n» What is COPPA?\nCOPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13. If you are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance. Please note that the phpBB Group cannot provide legal advice and is not a point of contact for legal concerns of any kind, except as outlined below.\nTop\n» Why can’t I register?\nIt is possible the website owner has banned your IP address or disallowed the username you are attempting to register. The website owner could have also disabled registration to prevent new visitors from signing up. Contact a board administrator for assistance.\nTop\n» What does the “Delete all board cookies” do?\n“Delete all board cookies” deletes the cookies created by phpBB which keep you authenticated and logged into the board. It also provides functions such as read tracking if they have been enabled by the board owner. If you are having login or logout problems, deleting board cookies may help.\nTop\nUser Preferences and settings\n» How do I change my settings?\nIf you are a registered user, all your settings are stored in the board database. To alter them, visit your User Control Panel; a link can usually be found at the top of board pages. This system will allow you to change all your settings and preferences.\nTop\n» The times are not correct!\nIt is possible the time displayed is from a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, visit your User Control Panel and change your timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. If you are not registered, this is a good time to do so.\nTop\n» I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!\nIf you are sure you have set the timezone and Summer Time/DST correctly and the time is still incorrect, then the time stored on the server clock is incorrect. Please notify an administrator to correct the problem.\nTop\n» My language is not in the list!\nEither the administrator has not installed your language or nobody has translated this board into your language. Try asking the board administrator if they can install the language pack you need. If the language pack does not exist, feel free to create a new translation. More information can be found at the phpBB website (see link at the bottom of board pages).\nTop\n» How do I show an image along with my username?\nThere are two images which may appear along with a username when viewing posts. One of them may be an image associated with your rank, generally in the form of stars, blocks or dots, indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the board. Another, usually a larger image, is known as an avatar and is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and to choose the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars, contact a board administrator and ask them for their reasons.\nTop\n» What is my rank and how do I change it?\nRanks, which appear below your username, indicate the number of posts you have made or identify certain users, e.g. moderators and administrators. In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board ranks as they are set by the board administrator. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank. Most boards will not tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.\nTop\n» When I click the e-mail link for a user it asks me to login?\nOnly registered users can send e-mail to other users via the built-in e-mail form, and only if the administrator has enabled this feature. This is to prevent malicious use of the e-mail system by anonymous users.\nTop\nPosting Issues\n» How do I post a topic in a forum?\nTo post a new topic in a forum, click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. A list of your permissions in each forum is available at the bottom of the forum and topic screens. Example: You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc.\nTop\n» How do I edit or delete a post?\nUnless you are a board administrator or moderator, you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post by clicking the edit button for the relevant post, sometimes for only a limited time after the post was made. If someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic which lists the number of times you edited it along with the date and time. This will only appear if someone has made a reply; it will not appear if a moderator or administrator edited the post, though they may leave a note as to why they’ve edited the post at their own discretion. Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.\nTop\n» How do I add a signature to my post?\nTo add a signature to a post you must first create one via your User Control Panel. Once created, you can check the Attach a signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio button in your profile. If you do so, you can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box within the posting form.\nTop\n» How do I create a poll?\nWhen posting a new topic or editing the first post of a topic, click the “Poll creation” tab below the main posting form; if you cannot see this, you do not have appropriate permissions to create polls. Enter a title and at least two options in the appropriate fields, making sure each option is on a separate line in the textarea. You can also set the number of options users may select during voting under “Options per user”, a time limit in days for the poll (0 for infinite duration) and lastly the option to allow users to amend their votes.\nTop\n» Why can’t I add more poll options?\nThe limit for poll options is set by the board administrator. If you feel you need to add more options to your poll than the allowed amount, contact the board administrator.\nTop\n» How do I edit or delete a poll?\nAs with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator or an administrator. To edit a poll, click to edit the first post in the topic; this always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote, users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if members have already placed votes, only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it. This prevents the poll’s options from being changed mid-way through a poll.\nTop\n» Why can’t I access a forum?\nSome forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post or perform another action you may need special permissions. Contact a moderator or board administrator to grant you access.\nTop\n» Why can’t I add attachments?\nAttachment permissions are granted on a per forum, per group, or per user basis. The board administrator may not have allowed attachments to be added for the specific forum you are posting in, or perhaps only certain groups can post attachments. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you are unable to add attachments.\nTop\n» Why did I receive a warning?\nEach board administrator has their own set of rules for their site. If you have broken a rule, you may be issued a warning. Please note that this is the board administrator’s decision, and the phpBB Group has nothing to do with the warnings on the given site. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you were issued a warning.\nTop\n» How can I report posts to a moderator?\nIf the board administrator has allowed it, you should see a button for reporting posts next to the post you wish to report. Clicking this will walk you through the steps necessary to report the post.\nTop\n» What is the “Save” button for in topic posting?\nThis allows you to save passages to be completed and submitted at a later date. To reload a saved passage, visit the User Control Panel.\nTop\n» Why does my post need to be approved?\nThe board administrator may have decided that posts in the forum you are posting to require review before submission. It is also possible that the administrator has placed you in a group of users whose posts require review before submission. Please contact the board administrator for further details.\nTop\n» How do I bump my topic?\nBy clicking the “Bump topic” link when you are viewing it, you can “bump” the topic to the top of the forum on the first page. However, if you do not see this, then topic bumping may be disabled or the time allowance between bumps has not yet been reached. It is also possible to bump the topic simply by replying to it, however, be sure to follow the board rules when doing so.\nTop\nFormatting and Topic Types\n» What is BBCode?\nBBCode is a special implementation of HTML, offering great formatting control on particular objects in a post. The use of BBCode is granted by the administrator, but it can also be disabled on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML, but tags are enclosed in square brackets [ and ] rather than < and >. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.\nTop\n» Can I use HTML?\nNo. It is not possible to post HTML on this board and have it rendered as HTML. Most formatting which can be carried out using HTML can be applied using BBCode instead.\nTop\n» What are Smilies?\nSmilies, or Emoticons, are small images which can be used to express a feeling using a short code, e.g. :) denotes happy, while :( denotes sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen in the posting form. Try not to overuse smilies, however, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may edit them out or remove the post altogether. The board administrator may also have set a limit to the number of smilies you may use within a post.\nTop\n» Can I post images?\nYes, images can be shown in your posts. If the administrator has allowed attachments, you may be able to upload the image to the board. Otherwise, you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.example.com/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor images stored behind authentication mechanisms, e.g. hotmail or yahoo mailboxes, password protected sites, etc. To display the image use the BBCode [img] tag.\nTop\n» What are global announcements?\nGlobal announcements contain important information and you should read them whenever possible. They will appear at the top of every forum and within your User Control Panel. Global announcement permissions are granted by the board administrator.\nTop\n» What are announcements?\nAnnouncements often contain important information for the forum you are currently reading and you should read them whenever possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. As with global announcements, announcement permissions are granted by the board administrator.\nTop\n» What are sticky topics?\nSticky topics within the forum appear below announcements and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them whenever possible. As with announcements and global announcements, sticky topic permissions are granted by the board administrator.\nTop\n» What are locked topics?\nLocked topics are topics where users can no longer reply and any poll it contained was automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons and were set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You may also be able to lock your own topics depending on the permissions you are granted by the board administrator.\nTop\n» What are topic icons?\nTopic icons are author chosen images associated with posts to indicate their content. The ability to use topic icons depends on the permissions set by the board administrator.\nTop\nUser Levels and Groups\n» What are Administrators?\nAdministrators are members assigned with the highest level of control over the entire board. These members can control all facets of board operation, including setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc., dependent upon the board founder and what permissions he or she has given the other administrators. They may also have full moderator capabilities in all forums, depending on the settings put forth by the board founder.\nTop\n» What are Moderators?\nModerators are individuals (or groups of individuals) who look after the forums from day to day. They have the authority to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally, moderators are present to prevent users from going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.\nTop\n» What are usergroups?\nUsergroups are groups of users that divide the community into manageable sections board administrators can work with. Each user can belong to several groups and each group can be assigned individual permissions. This provides an easy way for administrators to change permissions for many users at once, such as changing moderator permissions or granting users access to a private forum.\nTop\n» Where are the usergroups and how do I join one?\nYou can view all usergroups via the “Usergroups” link within your User Control Panel. If you would like to join one, proceed by clicking the appropriate button. Not all groups have open access, however. Some may require approval to join, some may be closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the group is open, you can join it by clicking the appropriate button. If a group requires approval to join you may request to join by clicking the appropriate button. The user group leader will need to approve your request and may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not harass a group leader if they reject your request; they will have their reasons.\nTop\n» How do I become a usergroup leader?\nA usergroup leader is usually assigned when usergroups are initially created by a board administrator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup, your first point of contact should be an administrator; try sending a private message.\nTop\n» Why do some usergroups appear in a different colour?\nIt is possible for the board administrator to assign a colour to the members of a usergroup to make it easy to identify the members of this group.\nTop\n» What is a “Default usergroup”?\nIf you are a member of more than one usergroup, your default is used to determine which group colour and group rank should be shown for you by default. The board administrator may grant you permission to change your default usergroup via your User Control Panel.\nTop\n» What is “The team” link?\nThis page provides you with a list of board staff, including board administrators and moderators and other details such as the forums they moderate.\nTop\nPrivate Messaging\n» I cannot send private messages!\nThere are three reasons for this; you are not registered and/or not logged on, the board administrator has disabled private messaging for the entire board, or the board administrator has prevented you from sending messages. Contact a board administrator for more information.\nTop\n» I keep getting unwanted private messages!\nYou can block a user from sending you private messages by using message rules within your User Control Panel. If you are receiving abusive private messages from a particular user, inform a board administrator; they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages.\nTop\n» I have received a spamming or abusive e-mail from someone on this board!\nWe are sorry to hear that. The e-mail form feature of this board includes safeguards to try and track users who send such posts, so e-mail the board administrator with a full copy of the e-mail you received. It is very important that this includes the headers that contain the details of the user that sent the e-mail. The board administrator can then take action.\nTop\nFriends and Foes\n» What are my Friends and Foes lists?\nYou can use these lists to organise other members of the board. Members added to your friends list will be listed within your User Control Panel for quick access to see their online status and to send them private messages. Subject to template support, posts from these users may also be highlighted. If you add a user to your foes list, any posts they make will be hidden by default.\nTop\n» How can I add / remove users to my Friends or Foes list?\nYou can add users to your list in two ways. Within each user’s profile, there is a link to add them to either your Friend or Foe list. Alternatively, from your User Control Panel, you can directly add users by entering their member name. You may also remove users from your list using the same page.\nTop\nSearching the Forums\n» How can I search a forum or forums?\nEnter a search term in the search box located on the index, forum or topic pages. Advanced search can be accessed by clicking the “Advance Search” link which is available on all pages on the forum. How to access the search may depend on the style used.\nTop\n» Why does my search return no results?\nYour search was probably too vague and included many common terms which are not indexed by phpBB3. Be more specific and use the options available within Advanced search.\nTop\n» Why does my search return a blank page!?\nYour search returned too many results for the webserver to handle. Use “Advanced search” and be more specific in the terms used and forums that are to be searched.\nTop\n» How do I search for members?\nVisit to the “Members” page and click the “Find a member” link.\nTop\n» How can I find my own posts and topics?\nYour own posts can be retrieved either by clicking the “Search user’s posts” within the User Control Panel or via your own profile page. To search for your topics, use the Advanced search page and fill in the various options appropriately.\nTop\nTopic Subscriptions and Bookmarks\n» What is the difference between bookmarking and subscribing?\nBookmarking in phpBB3 is much like bookmarking in your web browser. You aren’t alerted when there’s an update, but you can come back to the topic later. Subscribing, however, will notify you when there is an update to the topic or forum on the board via your preferred method or methods.\nTop\n» How do I subscribe to specific forums or topics?\nTo subscribe to a specific forum, click the “Subscribe forum” link upon entering the forum. To subscribe to a topic, reply to the topic with the subscribe checkbox checked or click the “Subscribe topic” link within the topic itself.\nTop\n» How do I remove my subscriptions?\nTo remove your subscriptions, go to your User Control Panel and follow the links to your subscriptions.\nTop\nAttachments\n» What attachments are allowed on this board?\nEach board administrator can allow or disallow certain attachment types. If you are unsure what is allowed to be uploaded, contact the board administrator for assistance.\nTop\n» How do I find all my attachments?\nTo find your list of attachments that you have uploaded, go to your User Control Panel and follow the links to the attachments section.\nTop\nphpBB 3 Issues\n» Who wrote this bulletin board?\nThis software (in its unmodified form) is produced, released and is copyright phpBB Group.

If you believe a feature needs to be added please visit the phpBB Ideas Centre, where you can upvote existing ideas or suggest new features.\nTop\n» Who do I contact about abusive and/or legal matters related to this board?\nAny of the administrators listed on the “The team” page should be an appropriate point of contact for your complaints. If this still gets no response then you should contact the owner of the domain (do a whois lookup) or, if this is running on a free service (e.g. Yahoo!, free.fr, f2s.com, etc.), the management or abuse department of that service.

They include the public sector; educational institutions; banks; golf resorts and many more.\nTestimonials\nMichael was the official Scots Gaelic localizer for Opera Software AS for 6 years, dealing with the main browser product, the mobile browser Opera Mini, Opera Mail and various other ancillary products. He was fast, reliable and thorough, with a keen eye for detail. He also worked tirelessly to report issues and help developers improve support for linguistic issues faced by non-English languages. A truly valued member of our team.\nSarah Lewandowski, Localization Director\nMichael worked with CereProc to build a Gaelic-language text-to-speech voice for the Scottish Government. Throughout the project, Michael worked with a high degree of professionalism and made a major contribution to the project’s success. Through his broad experience in linguistics, localization, technology and Gaelic, Michael was quickly able to understand the technical requirements of building a synthesis voice and provided expert Gaelic knowledge, language resources and advice throughout the project. CereProc would be happy to work with Michael again on any future Gaelic-language projects.\nGraham Leary, Head of Professional Services\nMichael was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful when we needed assistance coming up with a grammatically correct Gaelic house name and a Gaelic business name. He made several really insightful suggestions and we were able to settle on the names we needed quickly and easily. We’d certainly recommend him and will undoubtedly work with him again if the need should arise. Thank you, Michael, for providing us with such a professional and invaluable service, and for remaining available and cordial throughout!\nJeanne and Joseph L\nMichael was always my first choice when I needed any translations or requirements into Scottish Gaelic. Professional, responsive, dedicated, reliable, accurate and always on time, just what any PM would want! He would always go beyond and even point out things such as errors and inconsistencies in the source. That’s why he very quickly became our lead Scottish Gaelic linguist. I no longer work with this language combination but still miss working with Michael and would thoroughly recommend him and his services.\nMaría López, Senior Project Manager\nI reached out to Michael with a very small, personal translation for an inscription on a piece of jewellery. He responded quickly and made sure that he would be able to provide the help I was looking for before he accepted the job. He made some great suggestions which resulted in a piece that felt very personalized and true to the language and culture.\nKeelan C\nServices\nAkerbeltz offers a range of professional language services\nProfessional translation from and into Scottish Gaelic\nBrochures, websites, letters… pretty much any form of the written word. This specifically includes Software Localization, which is a particular area of expertise offered by Akerbeltz.\nSmall Translations\nJust have a sentence, motto or short passage you would like translated? Not a problem, the Small Translation Offer caters precisely for this kind of request and includes a translation, a transcription into the International Phonetic Alphabet, a transcription into a traditional font and a voice recording of your translation.\nProofreading\nHave your translation checked for spelling errors, grammar or bad idiom.\nLinguistic Consultancy\nPronunciation guides for dictionaries or phrasebooks, how to avoid common pitfalls in bilingual signage and packaging.\nPronunciation Training\nInstruction in how to produce the sounds of Scottish Gaelic correctly. This can be on a 1-1 basis or in small groups. Ideal for groups or individuals learning Gaelic, choirs. If you prefer to study on your own, you may like to consider my book on this topic, the culmination of more than 15 years of work in this area.\nPlease remember, irrespective of whether you use Akerbeltz or some other professional translator, Google Translate is at best a tool that will translate the gist of something into another language. Whether destined for paper, cyberspace, a billboard or your skin, it does not produce reliable Scottish Gaelic translations\nAbout\nA respected language consultant who specialises in Scottish Gaelic translation, lexicography and teaching of high-quality pronunciation. Expert in Scottish Gaelic as used in ICT applications. Almost two decades of experience dealing with the technical to the mundane. Brings a broad perspective to translation that ensures coherence and consistency.\nContact\nPlease don’t hesitate to contact me, whether you would like to just make a preliminary enquiry or if you have an urgent job that needs done yesterday. I’m always happy to talk and we promise to do our best to accommodate your needs.\nIf you’re enquiring about a small translation (for example for a tattoo), it’s helpful if you include the word/phrase you would like translated.\nPlease note that this is not a free translation service. I have to pay my bills same as everyone else.\nAlso note that Scottish Gaelic is not the same language as Irish Gaelic or Manx Gaelic. I only work with Scottish Gaelic.","dump":"your_dataset_name"}

It won't grant you any sort of ''magical powers'', but it can increase your focus and your touch with your faith, whether that be in nature or the energy around you. Whatever you look to when casting.\nNyxGeminia\nApr 28, 2021\nRight. This won't grant any ''magical powers'' but it can help you become closer to nature and it will help you use magick easier. I tried this a few years ago expecting to get supernatural abilities when that in fact will not work. All it did was empower me slightly, gave me a bit more focus in what I was doing, and helped me channel my own energy easier. While it may work in a realistic way, you cannot possibly hope to get supernatural abilities from it.\nShiroKyubi\nFeb 17, 2019\nDoes this work for 2 people?\nNordStar\nFeb 17, 2019\nThis is not necessary to become a witch. If you want to be a witch, learn what magic is, what it can do, what it cannot do, and how it works.\nTadashi\nNov 09, 2019\nWitches are merely humans who practice witchcraft, you do not need a spell to be a witch, simply study and practice the path. As for Demonica.w you are living in a fantasy world and do not understand what real witches and Pagans are like. I am a natural-born witch, my parents are Wiccan, and I was not only raised Wiccan, but I grew up around Pagans. While one can befriend angels and demons, your claims of having a ''human side'' leads me to conclude you are telling tall tales with the perception of sounding special. You are a witch, there is not a ''witch side'' you live this path completely. You are 100% witch, and 100% human at the same time.\nPrint Spell\nPrint Spell\nIs this content used without proper permission?\nPlease report any violations of copyright via our contact page.\n* All information on this page is provided by the coven or person named and the contents of this page is not mediated by the administrators of the website.

The delayed payment period starts from the date of order (including pre-ordered items and those not ready for immediate dispatch).\nThe delayed payment period and qualifying minimum order value is subject to offer and your account status. If you are eligible for BNPL your offer details will be confirmed in checkout.\nHow is interest calculated?\nInterest is calculated from date of order and compounded daily. The interest will be added to your account as a lump sum at the end of the delayed payment period. This means you will pay interest on interest.\nHow to avoid paying interest?\nYou can avoid all of the interest by paying the cash price before the end of the delayed payment period, this can be done in one full payment or multiple partial payments. Making partial payments without clearing the cash price in full will reduce the amount of interest charged at the end of the delayed payment period.\nRemember, if you choose not to pay the cash price before the end of the delayed payment period a lump sum of compound interest will be charged to your account.\nHow do I make a BNPL payment?\nTo make a full or partial payment simply log into your account. You can allocate your payment to the specific BNPL you wish to pay off. Alternatively, you can call us.\nWhat happens after the delayed payment period?\nIf you have paid the cash price in full before the end of the delayed payment period, you will not pay any interest.\nIf you have not paid the cash price in full or have only made a partial payment, a lump sum of interest will be charged to your account. Any outstanding balance plus the interest will now become payable.\nAs the outstanding balance, plus the interest now form part of your payable balance they will attract interest at your account rate, meaning you will pay interest on interest. This will be included within your account minimum payment request every month and cannot be repaid using Take 3.\nWhat is excluded from BNPL?\nThe costs for delivery, installation services and monthly insurance products cannot be placed on BNPL.\nDo I still have to pay my monthly minimum payment?\nYes, allocating payments to BNPL will not cover the minimum payment on your account. If you have a non-BNPL balance, you will still need to make at least your minimum payment as shown on your statement.","dump":"your_dataset_name"}
